/// All property types here are derived from existing A, N, or D from M3
/// with minimal logic for verification.  Generally if it's N under 10
/// digits it was treated as an int, 10 digits long, and more than 10 as
/// as a decimal.  This means some smaller decimals might be missed, and
/// in this case, will throw a conversion error.  If there is specific
/// conversions that were missed, please correct and notify for mainline
/// inclusion.
///
/// All fields are prefixed with M3_ as C# doesn not handle numeric leading
/// digits and some return values fall into this category.  So it was decided
/// that we standardize on a leading prefix
